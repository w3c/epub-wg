# EPUB 3 Working Group

This is the repository for the home page of the W3C EPUB 3 Working Group:

https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/epub-wg/

(That URL is redirected to the `w3c.github.io` view of this repository.)

## Specifications

GitHub repositories are linked from each specification. There is a separate [list of repos of this WG](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aepub-wg+org%3Aw3c&type=Repositories).


## Contributing to the EPUB Working Group Repositories

Use the standard fork, branch, and pull request workflow to propose changes to the specification. Please make branch names informativeâ€”by including the issue or bug number for example.

Editorial changes that improve the readability of the spec or correct spelling or grammatical mistakes are welcome.

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), about licensing contributions.

## Tools

Generating weekly minutes is done via the [scribejs](https://github.com/w3c/scribejs) script and some additional configuration settings provided in this repo (see `.scribejs.json`).

To use this repository's scribejs setup first install the tools...

```bash
$ npm install
```

Then run the following (with date information changed to match your scenario):

```bash
$ npm run scribejs -- -d 2020-09-01 -o _minutes/2020-09-01-epub-wg.md
```

This will request the IRC logs for the correct channel and convert them into the Kramdown (a more feature rich form of Markdown) with settings to match this repositories other documents.


If you need to make edits to the IRC log before generating the output (due to incorrect scribenick or similar), you can download the W3C logs from URLs such as `https://www.w3.org/2020/09/01-epub-wg-irc.txt`. Once downloaded, you can reference that input document directly (rather than using the automatic date-based retrieval).

For example:

```bash
$ curl https://www.w3.org/2020/09/01-epub-wg-irc.txt > 2020-09-01-epub-irc.txt
$ npm run scribejs -- 2020-09-01-epub-irc.txt -d 2020-09-01 -o _minutes/2020-09-01-epub.md
```


Edit the .txt file and repeat the `npm run scribejs` line as necessary. Once finished, you can commit the `.md` file and delete the `.txt` file (or keep it for your records).

Alternatively, you can also use the [browser interface to scribejs](https://w3c.github.io/scribejs/BrowserView/) relying on your local clone of the WG's repository.

### Jekyll

This site is built for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). If you have Jekyll and npm installed, you can run `npm run serve` to have Jekyll watch the working directory for changes and compile the templates (etc) incrementally.

Once run, you can browse the site at `http://localhost:4000/publishing/groups/epub-wg/` (the extra path information is *required* to match the w3.org hosting location).
