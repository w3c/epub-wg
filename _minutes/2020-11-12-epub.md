**Shinya Takami (高見真也):** welcome everyone  

### 1. align-x-center
{: #section1}

**github:** [https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1380](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1380)  

**Shinya Takami (高見真也):** this is not supported by major reading systems  
… and perhaps not very many files use this?  

**Toshiaki Koike:** proposed on github  

> *Dave Cramer:* [https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1380#issuecomment-719108924](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1380#issuecomment-719108924)

**Toshiaki Koike:** every reader can implement  
… this feature is supported by voyager reading system, but not many epub files use this feature  
… he expects epubcheck would not mark as error  

**Dave Cramer:** not sure how epubcheck will deal with `<meta>` properties... it actually might be easier  
… am I correct that people don't really see this as necessary/  

**Shinya Takami (高見真也):** yes

### 2. CSS Writing Modes reference
{: #section2}

**github:** [https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1389](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1389)  

**Dave Cramer:** this was done deliberately  

**Florian Rivoal:** there were several kinds of changes to writing modes between its reference and rec  
… some are easy to deal with; some less so  
… from a behaviour change, there hasn't been much, if we ignore the syntax  
… there is one part which has changed a lot, but it's the detailed, nuanced part  
… and I doubt that epub readers implemented the correct part  
… the old behaviour was badly defined  
… about sizing elements with mixed elements  
… automatic sizing inside horizontal text inside vertical text, for example  
… I would be surprised if that was a problem  
… but there have been syntax changes  
… we might need to maintain a list of aliases  
… and just document that  
… more tricky is that some features have been removed  
… hopefully they haven't been used  
… some features were moved to level 4  
… text-combine-upright: digits was moved from level 3 to level 4  
… and this one may still change because browsers have not yet implemented  
… so if you document the syntax in the EPUB spec  
… and then say for behaviour look to writing modes  
… the trickier one is the complete removal  

> *Dave Cramer:* [https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/epub33/core/#sec-css-prefixed-writing-modes](https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/epub33/core/#sec-css-prefixed-writing-modes)

**Florian Rivoal:** [makes same points (presumably!) in Japanese]  

**Dave Cramer:** so we can just point to the current spec, and identify aliases to current syntax and behaviours  
… I think there's work for the editors to do to clean up this section, then we can get feedback from the wg  

**Shinya Takami (高見真也):** that sounds good  

### 3. Patent Policy
{: #section3}

**Shinya Takami (高見真也):** w3c released a new patent policy right after this WG was chartered  
… so we are officially using the old patent policy  
… but we could switch to the new patent policy  
… so I invited Florian (from the W3C AB) to explain the new policy  

**Florian Rivoal:** one main difference between old and new  
… with the old policy, when you reach CR, you get asked if you have any patents you want to exclude  
… if you say you won't give a license, then a special group is formed  
… if you don't answer, or say it's ok, you promise to license them to everyone at no cost  
… you don't make this promise immediately; only when the spec becomes REC  
… so there's no license during CR; just a promise for a license later  
… with the new policy, same thing--you get asked at CR  
… but if you're OK with the patents at CR, you license them immediately (rather than waiting until REC)  
… another minor difference: when the old policy was written, people imagined that one WG produces one REC, then it's over  
… they did not consider groups publishing multiple or updated specifications  
… so there was ambiguity  

**Dave Cramer:** we have multiple specs. does it make sense to move to the new policy?  

**Florian Rivoal:** yes. with multiple specs, there is potentially an issue... it would likely work out  
… the old patent policy is not clear about the same spec going to rec multiple times  
… especially if some people leave the group

### 4. unsupported features
{: #section4}

**Shinya Takami (高見真也):** deprecated features: authors are strongly recommended not to use  
… reading systems may support  
… legacy features: authors may include  
… reading systems must not support  
… I have a suggestion that we need a third category  
… where authors are strongly recommended NOT to use  
… reading systems should support  

**Dave Cramer:** another factor is epubcheck  

**Florian Rivoal:** I think I agree  
… I propose that the third group be called "compatiblity features"  
… maybe for epubcheck a low priority warning  
… like in verbose mode  

**Dave Cramer:** there are info alerts in EPUBCheck  

**Florian Rivoal:** it's also probably useful to say what happens if both properties are used  

**Dave Cramer:** what about the cascade  

**Florian Rivoal:** the model also tells what happens from script  

**Toshiaki Koike:** (in Japanese)  
… with current versions of epub check, when using vendor prefixes, we don't issue any warning or info  
… should we issue an info only for epub prefixes?  

**Florian Rivoal:** my opinion is that it is low priority  
… when we know what unprefixed property should be used  

**Dave Cramer:** we're not sure how much we want to enforce restrictions on CSS  

**Shinya Takami (高見真也):** in conclusion, we will continue to discuss unsupported features. I will file a GitHub issue.  
… and we can continue the discussion there.  

**RRSAgent:** make logs public  
… make logs public  
… bye
