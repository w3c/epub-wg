### 1. Summary of FXL and Virtual Locators calls
{: #section1}

**Wendy Reid:** we had calls for both TF this week  
… both moving forward  
… FXL TF has divided up the work we talked about last meeting  
… updating Daisy KB  
… best practices documentation (probably end up as WG note)  
… and modern HTML and CSS standards in epubs  
… Locators had a really productive calls  
… broke down the use-cases  
… we will review CFI to see what we can learn  

**Dan Fauxsmith:** CFI does what we need, but it is not that friendly  
… so we want to think about whether we can have something more user friendly  

**Wendy Reid:** we talked about whether there was anything we could do to make our solution as "webby" as possible  

**Dave Cramer:** there's some API that's supposed to solve the problem of how to locate something within a webpage  

**Wendy Reid:** the findtext API?  

**Brady Duga:** we release Chrome extension for making link to arbitrary location on a page (basically by finding some text)  

**Dave Cramer:** and having indexers involved is really good  

**Dan Fauxsmith:** they are enthusiastic and knowledgable, one of our indexers is a current PhD candidate in the ebook area  

### 2. language around rendition:flow

> *Dave Cramer:* See [Relevant comment within the PR](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/pull/1616#pullrequestreview-629109802)

**Dave Cramer:** I was concerned that we say RS MUST use auto as a default value, but auto means "RS, do whatever you want"  
… not sure that it was testable  
… but Dan thinks it is testable  
… so maybe we should just undo that resolution  
… if it is testable i'm fine with restoring that requirement  

**Brady Duga:** agree. Not worth spending much time on.  
… and agree with dlazin's testing method for it  

**Dave Cramer:** yes, we just need to see that things are consistent between having explicit auto value and "implied" auto

### 3. Getting rid of registries 
{: #section3}

_See github issue [#1602](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1602)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1602 -->



> *Dave Cramer:* [https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/epub33/rs/#sec-xhtml-custom-attributes](https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/epub33/rs/#sec-xhtml-custom-attributes)

**Dave Cramer:** we said that vendors may define custom attributes, and then we setup a custom registry to track these  
… HTML has quite a few ways for users to add attributes  
… it seems to me a that it would be a great benefit to remove something that was never used, and which takes as further from HTML  

**Dan Lazin:** why would this be bad for HTML?  

**Dave Cramer:** name space attributes create issues for us in future because we can't use them in HTML serialization  

**Dan Lazin:** so proposal here is to remove entire section on custom attributes?  

**Dave Cramer:** yes  

> **Proposed resolution: Remove all references to custom attributes** *(Wendy Reid)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

> *Dan Lazin:* +1

> *Brady Duga:* +1

> *Matthew Chan:* +1

> *Dave Cramer:* +idpf:1

> *Wendy Reid:* +1

> *Marisa DeMeglio:* +1

> *Shinya Takami (高見真也):* +1

> *Toshiaki Koike:* +1

> ***Resolution #2: Remove all references to custom attributes***
{: #resolution2 .resolution}

**Dan Lazin:** for clarity, when I reported that as bug, I thought that vendors WERE using this, but just not reporting into the registry  

**Dave Cramer:** no, don't think that is the case  

### 4. Restrictions on container-constraints scripts 
{: #section4}

_See github issue [#1523](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1523)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1523 -->



**Dave Cramer:** this refers to scripts that run inside iframes  
… we say that such scripts should not modify parent in DOM or other documents in publication, must not modify the size of its containing rectangle  
… the idea is that container-constrained scripts should stay in their containers  
… Ivan was wondering whether using attributes to do this would accomplish the same thing, and be checkable by epubcheck  
… i looked into the sandbox attribute, but nothing seemed like a perfect match for what we want to achieve  

**Brady Duga:** i don't think sandbox is appropriate here, its for security and we're concerned with layout  
… the fact that the script cannot touch things outside of yourself, is by definition  
… if you do touch outside things, no longer are you "container-constrained"  
… so maybe rewrite this language as defining what it is  
… "a container-constrained script is... doesn't affect things outside itself, etc."  
… and anything not contained is considered spine level  

**Dave Cramer:** but then who's responsibility is it to enforce that? The RS?  

**Brady Duga:** this is being done for publishers because we want to enable some scripting without breaking the content  
… if they chose to ignore this and the content breaks, then they'll just learn to stop  

**Dave Cramer:** Ivan was also concerned about this from a testing perspective  
… can't reasonably write a validator to check every javascript for whether or not it goes outside its container  
… but what we are leaning towards almost seems to move that section into the definitions  
… maybe we can take this back to Ivan and Matt?  

**Brady Duga:** you could almost just turn that paragraph into a bullet point  

**Dave Cramer:** or just say "container-constrained script does NOT... etc."  

**Wendy Reid:** okay, so maybe no proposal for now, and we can just comment on the github ticket  

**Marisa DeMeglio:** what do people use container-constrained scripts for?  
… widgets?  

**Brady Duga:** yeah, some little interactive thing. 3D model, for example  

### 5. Quick reference pages 
{: #section5}

_See github issue [#1517](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1517)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1517 -->



**Dave Cramer:** this is a feature request  
… someone wants to do pop-up reference pages, like a modal pop-up  
… it would appear to the user without changing the user's reading location  
… i think there have been precedents  
… sounds Microsoft Reader pagelits  
… linear="no", that spawned a pop-up in front of the existing page  
… this strikes me as potentially useful, but also a huge can of worms  
… we'd have to describe complex visual rendering of something in epub  
… how do we respond to requests like this?  
… we could say "use HTML techniques", but most of those may not work in epub  

**Wendy Reid:** this came up in Locators call  
… the question was raised about the positioning of index in RS  
… most RS have separate TOC that can be accessed without changing reading position  
… so what about index?  
… we've never seen it done  
… maybe cause there are clear indicators for what a TOC is  
… nothing analogous for index  
… i think we need to define how modals should appear, but maybe just elevate some common elements to same semantic level as TOC  
… like for index, map, etc.  
… then RS could choose to visually treat that the way they do TOCs  

**Brady Duga:** this is probably out of scope for now?  
… and it seems like maybe we could do this using existing markup  
… maybe have note, "if you have target blank pointing to something within the epub then display like a modal"  

**Dan Lazin:** if we were to grant this, people would use this to do all sorts of weird UI things  
… might be good for making ebooks less tied down to replicating print books  
… so this feature would be for whatever the authors wants to put in this separate window  
… but I'd like clarification on how we normally deal with feature requests  

**Dave Cramer:** the TOC is interesting because the spec mandates a navigation document  
… we call it out in the manifest  
… and we require that a RS make the text and links of navigation document available even if the linked document is not in the spine at all (linear="no")  
… epub is sort of different from the web because the RS decides how UI works, and author just provides the content inside  
… not sure what to think about attempts to change that fundamental division  
… open to experimentation in this area  
… i'd want to see interest from content creators and interest from RS developers  
… they need to tell us how such an interface would work  

**Dan Lazin:** something that seems analogous here is a widget framework like Chrome extension or Google Docs add-ons  
… those are more apps than content  
… but just like here, Google Docs creates the UI, but extensions have some control  
… we could think of 3 categories, normal content, model content, and non-modal content outside of the main document (e.g. sidebar)  

**Dave Cramer:** this sounds like a job for the CG  
… they can better incubate, gather support  
… and that's more our process for feature requests  
… also remember that Opera had something like this, like a "secondary browsing context"?  
… you could make it open a side window  

**Brady Duga:** agree that this should go to CG  
… we might want to have a more formal way to hook up the content experiments with the RS experiments  
… so that there is a place to test the experimental content and vice versa  

**Wendy Reid:** raise it with Mateus and Zheng  
… so we'll just comment on the issue and let them know that we are referring this to the CG  

**Dave Cramer:** and tag Mateus and Zheng  

### 6. What do we mean by support for "presentation logic"? 
{: #section6}

_See github issue [#1516](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1516)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1516 -->



**Dave Cramer:** we say RS must "honor presentation logic expressed through package document"  
… mgarrish thinks we should just delete it since we already require all the pieces of that in other places in the RS spec  
… making this statement redundant  

**Brady Duga:** agree  

**Marisa DeMeglio:** yes, agree

### 7. Handling non-Arabic page numbers 
{: #section7}

_See github issue [#1505](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1505)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1505 -->



**Dave Cramer:** what are the rules for RS when faced with non-Arabic page numbers?  

**Brady Duga:** are there any rules for handling Arabic page numbers?  

**Dave Cramer:** right, we haven't really said anything about this  

**Brady Duga:** Arabic or otherwise  

**Dave Cramer:** we've left a lot of these UI decisions up to RS  
… some RS will use the content of the pagelist if it exists instead of internal page numbering  
… assume these would just use whatever string is in there  

**Dan Lazin:** that's true for Apple  

**Brady Duga:** true in Play Books  

**Dave Cramer:** yep, backmatter in educational books often use letters  

**Brady Duga:** we often see a mix of Arabic numerals and other stuff  

**Dave Cramer:** not sure I see the problem here  
… is there any guidance in the pagelist section on this?  

**Wendy Reid:** don't think so  
… the context of this is really how RS communicate non-Arabic page numbers, but if RSes already have a solution...  

**Dan Lazin:** there is an issue with the string-based solution with TTS and AT  
… cannot pronounce arbitrary string  
… maybe possible to solve it with ARIA label?  

**Dave Cramer:** maybe have informative statement that if there is a pagelist, then RS should use strings embedded in pagelist?  
… if they want to present that to user?  

**Wendy Reid:** maybe refer this back to mgarrish? The a11y spec does not tell RS what to do, which is how it ended up here  
… maybe we need him to explain why this came up in a11y in the first place  

**Dave Cramer:** okay, so no resolution for now  
… further discussion to come  
… okay, thanks everyone!
