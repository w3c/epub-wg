### 1. Validation of SVG 
{: #section1}

_See github issue [#1323](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1323)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1323 -->



**Dave Cramer:** Validation of svg  
… Perhaps coming to consensus  
… maybe keep status quo  
… don't require validity now, just well formed, etc  
… duga mentions there is real harm to the validity check  
… propose informative messages when `validition.nu` check fails  
… no spec change, acknowledge reality of tools  

**Ivan Herman:** Fundamentally agree  
… Which category corresponds to the epub check behavior?  

**Dave Cramer:** Weird case since epubcheck is currently out of sync  
… with the spec.  

**Matt Garrish:** epubcheck follows the spec, but not entirely bound to it  
… epubcheck can do what it wants, only errors and warnings need to match spec  
… . Doesn't need a statement in the spec to justify it

### 2. `xml:base` in package document and elsewhere 
{: #section2}

_See github issue [#1456](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1456)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1456 -->



**Dave Cramer:** XML base  
… Have a pull request to remove a line  

_See github pull request [#1678](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/pull/1678)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1678 -->



**Dave Cramer:** xml base is disappearing from the world at large  
… It isn't forbidden, but not a useful requirement to support it  
… Authors shouldn't do it, and we should make it so RSes shouldn't support it in the future

### 3. Is our scripting requirement normative? 
{: #section3}

_See github pull request [#1671](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/pull/1671)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1671 -->


_See github issue [#1659](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1659)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1659 -->



**Dave Cramer:** Security and Privacy - trying to bring more rigor  

**Ivan Herman:** Unique origin (per epub) is something we have already decided  
… Implementing that resolution I hit two things  
… one editorial, one serious  
… There was a statement which said roughly "you should have a unique origin, but if you can't then do some hacks" (non-normative)  

> *Dave Cramer:* [https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/epub33/rs/#sec-scripted-content-security](https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/epub33/rs/#sec-scripted-content-security)

> “domain isolation is the most effective way to secure EPUB Publications in Web-based Reading Systems, it is not always a realistic option. Web-based Reading Systems must still maintain isolation in such cases, which may require limiting access to scripting APIs that allow client-side data storage and access.”

**Ivan Herman:** Didn't know what to do with that statement  
… I kept it to security and privacy, but there was a long thread of discussion on the request about what to do with it  
… General hand waving over what to do if you can't handle origins  
… There are several options about how to write it  
… but is tending towards the recommendation to dump it entirely  
… since it is now required to support origin  

**Brady Duga:** to add context, we did not have requirement around origin in the past  
… when we added that requirement, we needed to take out the lines that said it wasn't required. We have to revisit whether this isn't required if we take this out  

**Dave Cramer:** My instinct is to keep the normative requirement and get rid of the hand-waving  
… acknowledging that the architecture of some RSes might have issues with this  
… Don't see the need for the spec to recognize that  
… I would hope there are some tests that check the spirit of this  
… Really don't want cross-script data sharing  
… The web way to do that is to use distinct origins  
… If a RS can pass those tests then I am happy with it, regardless of how it is actually implemented

> ***Resolution #3: get rid of the hand-waving in PR 1671 on the origin issue***
{: #resolution3 .resolution}

**Ivan Herman:** Then there was also a more editorial question  
… the entire section has been enriched with more comments  
… but those items, while interesting, are not related to security and privacy  
… comments are around keeping data, which may be correct but is not S&P related  
… Is there a place to move this to? eg general best practices for scripting  
… if yes, then we should keep and enhance, otherwise we need to drop them  

**Dave Cramer:** I don't think we should do something like that (best practices)  
… These seem out of scope for the spec  
… Presumably people will figure it out  

**Brady Duga:** All of these comments are around preserving data, but the spec does not require that  
… you don't have to use web storage, etc  
… It would be tricky to write tips and tricks for specs that are not required  

> *Tzviya Siegman:* This is very niche - tips for supporting optional specs on top of optional features.

**Dave Cramer:** Don't feel qualified to recommend implementation details to devs  
… Seem to be drifting away from core responsibilities of the spec, would prefer fewer words here  

**Ivan Herman:** Essentially in agreement  
… Don't need a formal resolution (this isn't a normative statement), but will go ahead and remove those items  

**Hadrien Gardeur:** Question about previous item: have we discussed what APIs can be used?  
… Is there a policy or rough idea about our position?  

**Brady Duga:** historically, we've viewed scripting as experimental. We've left it up to authors, publishers, systems to decide what to support. It's a strange place to allow third party to decide what to do with user data. It's a scary place to be, and I don't think we should put into spec.  

**Ivan Herman:** An analogy - no one specifies which APIs must be implemented by a browser  
… It is rare (never?) to require specific API implementations  
… Just like a browser, it is up to RS authors to decide what they will implement  

### 4. Machine readable meta information for manifest items? 
{: #section4}

_See github issue [#1675](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1675)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1675 -->



**Dave Cramer:** Proposal to put metadata in the package file, particularly about copyright on specific manifest items  
… Use case is to allow scanning of documents to check copyright status  
… this concerns me  
… There are various mechanisms to do that now (eg RDF)  

**Brady Duga:** I don't understand the use case  

**Matt Garrish:** This seems half baked  
… Might want more detail before we consider it  
… It does seem like this can be done now, and the recommendation doesn't really cover it all  

**Tzviya Siegman:** Seems like this might be about the EU copyright directive  

> *Tzviya Siegman:* [https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2021/05/17/stm-article-sharing-framework/](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2021/05/17/stm-article-sharing-framework/)

**Tzviya Siegman:** Might be about the scholarly world where you can detect if something is shareable  
… Linked info above is still be discussed internationally  

**Hadrien Gardeur:** I think in general when we get these requests, we should point out the current extensibility  
… If some group comes up with a useful extension, then we can consider it  
… we shouldn't tackle these things ourselves  

> **Proposed resolution: Close issue 1675 without further steps** *(Ivan Herman)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

> *Ben Schroeter:* +1

**Dave Cramer:** We should close the issue, nothing to see here  

> *Dave Cramer:* +1

> *Bill Kasdorf:* +1

> *Brady Duga:* +1

> *Ivan Herman:* +1

> *Tzviya Siegman:* +1

> *Masakazu Kitahara:* +1

> *Matt Garrish:* +1

> ***Resolution #4: Close issue 1675 without further steps***
{: #resolution4 .resolution}

**Dave Cramer:** That was all our issues  

### 5. aob
{: #section5}

**Dave Cramer:** Remember there is a face to face coming up  
… If you want to talk about something ask the chairs, Ivan, or add the f2f label to the topic  

> *Ivan Herman:* Potential agenda for f2f: [https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Agenda%2B+F2F%22](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Agenda%2B+F2F%22)

**Matt Garrish:** What about republishing? Do we have a formal thumbs up?  

> *Gregorio Pellegrino:* +1

> *Charles LaPierre:* +1 updated docs!

> **Proposed resolution: republish all specs** *(Ivan Herman)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

> *Dave Cramer:* +1

> *Ben Schroeter:* +1

> *Brady Duga:* +1

> *Tzviya Siegman:* +1

> *Ivan Herman:* +1

> *Matt Garrish:* +1

> *Bill Kasdorf:* +1

> ***Resolution #5: republish all specs***
{: #resolution5 .resolution}

> *Tzviya Siegman:* [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jx5VvkMTQ4EL0Xfb3pDMDUiccq79mmIPHetSRfbziFM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jx5VvkMTQ4EL0Xfb3pDMDUiccq79mmIPHetSRfbziFM/edit?usp=sharing)

**Tzviya Siegman:** There has been talk about creating short videos to share with the larger publishing community  
… instead of a massive webinar  
… If you have ideas for videos let us know  
… will start creating videos over the summer  
… if your name is on this and you don't want to do it, let us know  
… If you do want to do one, just add your name to the linked sheet  

**Dave Cramer:** AOB?  
… Thanks all! You can all go home
