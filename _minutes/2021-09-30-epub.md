### 1. TPAC Registration
{: #section1}

> *Wendy Reid:* See [TPAC Registration page](https://www.w3.org/2021/10/TPAC/Overview.html#participation)

**Wendy Reid:** don't forget to register for TPAC  

### 2. Global Language Support
{: #section2}

_See github issue [#1809](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1809)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1809 -->



_See github pull request [#1816](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/pull/1816)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1816 -->



**Matt Garrish:** Global language support is talked about in EPUB3 overview... does it belong there?  

**Murata Makoto:** no strong opinion, but at that time global language support was important to promote EPUB3; this is no longer the case.  

**Wendy Reid:** change would make the overview more like a W3C document instead of a sales document  

**Matt Garrish:** I'm good either way

### 3. Schema in EPUB Accessibility
{: #section3}

_See github issue [#1799](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1799)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1799 -->



_See github pull request [#1808](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/pull/1808)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1808 -->



**Matt Garrish:** we started off listing the `schema.org` properties, then we went to the ISO version of the document where `schema.org` is not considered very normative, so we referred to the techniques document... so we have to prove that `schema.org` is a stable and valid reference  
… we need to show there is a method for maintaining the vocabularies. Need to work with W3C; it is an ongoing conversation. Still in limbo until we have a proper home for the metadata.  

**Dave Cramer:** can we merge the pull request?  

**Matt Garrish:** would like to get a formal ok first from Ivan  

**Dave Cramer:** we should merge it instead of leaving it hanging as we seek horizontal reviews, etc.  

**Wendy Reid:** we reference schema elsewhere  

**Matt Garrish:** we have a mapping file in those cases  

**Murata Makoto:** can we use living document?  

**Wendy Reid:** there are procedures for using living documents  

**Dave Cramer:** can we propose to merge the PR?  

**Matt Garrish:** it's been referenced in other standards, yet we need to show stability even though it's been allowed elsewhere  
… need a repository and issue tracker to show that we maintain it properly  

**Murata Makoto:** Registries are considered a back door for extending international standards; that's why ISO doesn't like it. Also there are fees associated.  

**Matt Garrish:** it's a gray area. It's part of the web and we have to work with it.  

> *Murata Makoto:* Let's make Ivan's life interesting!

### 4. Testing Update
{: #section4}

> *Wendy Reid:* See [Video of last weeks presentation](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/epub-wg/Meetings/Minutes/2021-09-24-epub#section1)

> *Wendy Reid:* See [EPUB test repository](https://github.com/w3c/epub-tests)

**Wendy Reid:** We did an update on testing last week. Lot's of updates to the testing repository. There's a link to the video on how to create tests. Also step by step instructions.  
… there are templates, you can create tests, snd track what's been tested.  

**Dan Lazin:** we've been tracking on a spreadsheet which may be obsolete with these better tools  

**Murata Makoto:** do we need a test for every feature in EPUB3?  

**Dan Lazin:** we need to test for every MUST and some SHOULDs  

> *Wendy Reid:* See [See the description of testing](https://github.com/w3c/epub-tests#step-by-step)

**Dan Lazin:** if you're going to write a test, you should explain in the test repo what you are testing (and what not)  

**Wendy Reid:** if there is an item you would like to see on the TPAC agenda, let us know.  

**Dave Cramer:** TPAC may be our last chance to do big things in EPUB 3.3 - we don't want to make major changes after CR unless it's a result of testing  

> *Dave Cramer:* RRSAgent: bye
