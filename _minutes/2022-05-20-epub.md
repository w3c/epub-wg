### 1. Testing.
{: #section1}

**Dave Cramer:** big topic of the day is testing. Now that we are in CR we must show that our spec is implementable?.  
… Internationalization had to re-review and re-approve, had to iterate with security and privacy, but all got resolved.  

> *Dave Cramer:* See [Testing table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13wgptApSVbQbYzi2L5VXe3D_1QLzJOTGySUAtOxn4sA/edit#gid=0).

> *Dan Lazin:* [https://tinyurl.com/epub-tests](https://tinyurl.com/epub-tests).

**Dan Lazin:** These links are long and short URLs for the tests.  
… We need people to write tests.  
… 63 missing tests.  
… some are untestable.  
… descriptions are in column D.  
… put your name in column E.  

> *Dan Lazin:* See [test descriptions](https://w3c.github.io/epub-tests/).

**Dan Lazin:** just need to whittle down the number and get the easy tests out of the way.  

> *Dan Lazin:* See [how to contribute to tests](https://w3c.github.io/epub-tests/contributing).

**Dan Lazin:** this link is instructions for how to write a test.  
… we have a Slack channel or you can [email me](mailto:dlazin@google.com) and I'll walk you through the process.  
… complete the metadata too so an RS evaluator can understand the test.  
… and link the spec to the test.  
… make sure the EPUB validates.  
… when done, fork the repo for the spec tested. unique anchors are already populated.  

**Zheng Xu (徐征):** There are two specs, EPUB and RS - do we need both or just RS? Do we need to test all Reading Systems?.  

**Dan Lazin:** just create the test, don't worry about testing in the EPUB.  
… if a test fails EPUBcheck (intentionally), there is metadata for that. Or maybe we still need to add that..  

**Brady Duga:** one thing that worries me about writing test is that we need to be aware of copyright.  
… if you use fonts media, text, we need to make sure our licenses match W3C's licenses.  

**Dan Lazin:** current core media tests have stuff you can repurpose.  
… didn't check in font license to test, so may need to reconsider.  
… we can swap out for licensed fonts later.  

**Brady Duga:** consider a AHEM for fonts.  

> *Dave Cramer:* See [Ahem font for testing](https://github.com/Kozea/Ahem).

**Brady Duga:** these instructions are great, thanks Dan.  

**Dan Lazin:** take a quick look at existing tests before you make one.  

**Dave Cramer:** Zheng, you had additional agenda items?.  

**Zheng Xu (徐征):** once I send pull request, do I close my issue?.  

**Dan Lazin:** yes.  
… when preparing tests, please use as opportunity to improve the spec if you find something that is not clear.  

### 2. Publishing CG.
{: #section2}

**Zheng Xu (徐征):** pcg meeting second week of each month.  
… we could recruit testers.  

**Tzviya Siegman:** if we're trying to get the CG to help the WG, it might be easier to bring the WG to the CG.  

> *Dave Cramer:* See [Deferred issues in EPUB 3.3](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AStatus-Deferred).

**Avneesh Singh:** WG should prepare a list of issues that were deferred from EPUB 3.3 like HTML vs XHTML. That would be a good topic for discussion with community group.  

**Tzviya Siegman:** we try to present as problems we want to solve as opposed to solutions.  

> *Brady Duga:* Use cases for html vs xhtml: Use of the shelf tools for content creation, use popular scripting libraries, better align with other standards.

**Zheng Xu (徐征):** would like to share use cases from community group.  

> *Tzviya Siegman:* [https://github.com/w3c/publishingcg/issues/27](https://github.com/w3c/publishingcg/issues/27) i.

**Zheng Xu (徐征):** perhaps WG would want to standardize these use cases to be RS agnostic.  

> *Avneesh Singh:* better to discuss Media Overlays advancements on sync media community group.

> *Dave Cramer:* [https://github.com/w3c/publishingcg/issues/33/](https://github.com/w3c/publishingcg/issues/33/).

> *Dave Cramer:* [https://github.com/w3c/publishingcg/issues/34/](https://github.com/w3c/publishingcg/issues/34/).

**Dave Cramer:** having a separate navigation document is a foundational pillar of EPUB, so hesitant to move away from that unless we can be sure of benefits.  

### 3. AOB.
{: #section3}

**Brady Duga:** cheap rooms for TPAC are almost gone. Is there a block of rooms for W3C?.  

**Dan Lazin:** will ask Ivan.  

**Tzviya Siegman:** I'l try to look into it.
