**Brady Duga:** welcome everyone. It's been a few weeks. Wendy and Dave are unavailable today, so I am guest chairing.  

### 1. Information exposure and fingerprintability.
{: #section1}

_See github issue [epub-specs#1872](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1872)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1872 -->



**Brady Duga:** adding the name and version number to the `epubReadingSystem` object in js exposes additional information, which allows authors of epubs to gather more information about the user than the user may expect.  
… there's been discussion about removing the object entirely, or specific attributes of the object.  
… also, whether the `epubReadingSystem` object really exposes more information than navigator.UserAgent.  
… i feel is is dangerous for RS to allow access to network + scripting anyway.  
… does anyone use this information if you are publisher of scripted epub content?.  

> *Murata Makoto:* Hard to believe so.

**Matt Garrish:** Dave said that he had figured out that an epub was being read on an Apple device, but that was the only practical example of it being used.  

**Brady Duga:** happy to make it disappear, but we have a backwards compatibility issue maybe?.  

**Shinya Takami (高見真也):** I will address our JP members in Japanese now.  
… [in Japanese].  
… okay JP RS vendor, Voyager, says that their plan is to omit the `epubReadingSystem` object, but that this has not been done yet.  

**Brady Duga:** do they expose the name and version number attributes?.  

**Shinya Takami (高見真也):** this is controlled by the browser, they say?.  

**Brady Duga:** no, we're referring specifically to the `epubReadingSystem` object, not the browser `UserAgent` object.  
… but all of this is "should" territory, because it is not clear that everyone who supports scripting supports the `epubReadingSystem` object (even though the spec says they should).  

> *Brady Duga:* See `navigator.epubReadingSystem.name: Thorium`.

**Shinya Takami (高見真也):** so the `epubReadingSystem` object is provided by the RS, not by the browser?.  

**Brady Duga:** yes, specifically the `epubReadingSystem` object added by the RS.  

**Shinya Takami (高見真也):** [in Japanese...].  
… maybe Thorium uses this object, but Voyager does not support it.  

> *Murata Makoto:* Great!.

**Brady Duga:** okay, good news then? Because there is no objection to deprecating it then.  

**Matt Garrish:** epubcheck doesn't detect this object right now, so whether or not we deprecate it probably won't majorly affect the landscape.  

**Brady Duga:** and we're talking here specifically about deprecating the name and version attributes, yes?.  

**Matt Garrish:** yes.  

**Brady Duga:** are we concerned that newer RS that omit these attributes could be fingerprinted by their absence?.  
… i'd be happy to go ahead with deprecation still.  

> **Proposed resolution: Deprecate name and version properties on the `epubReadingSystem` object.** *(Brady Duga)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

> *Brady Duga:* +1.

> *Matt Garrish:* +1.

> *Matthew Chan:* +1.

> *Shinya Takami (高見真也):* +1.

> *Toshiaki Koike:* +1.

> *Masakazu Kitahara:* +1.

> ***Resolution #1: Deprecate name and version properties on the `epubReadingSystem` object.***

### 2. Content Signing and Theft.
{: #section2}

**Brady Duga:** not 100% clear what this topic meant. I don't think we really mean 'theft' here, its probably not accurate. Assuming that this is just about content signing, does anyone have comments?.  

**Shinya Takami (高見真也):** at the last Publishing group meeting, the issue was raised that with DRM being imperfect, we may want to think about digital signing to authenticate content.  
… the purpose is to generally share ideas before we take this up with other related WG.  

> *Shinya Takami (高見真也):* for example: [https://iscc.codes](https://iscc.codes).

**Brady Duga:** i'm interested in content signing for purposes of verifying the publishers, so users can tell provenance of content. I'm wary about addressing the topic of piracy.  
… barring any other comments, i'm happy to take this up with the Business Group.  

**Shinya Takami (高見真也):** the link above is a summary of our discussion of this topic 2-3 weeks ago.  
… do we think some discussion about this sort of technology belongs in the epub spec?.  

**Matt Garrish:** I think this also came up through npd. #2265 was about an authenticity check.  
… probably something we can address longer term, but maybe not in epub 3.3.  

_See github issue [epub-specs#2265](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/2265)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/2265 -->



**Brady Duga:** right, using signing to determine if the claimed author of epub is actually who they say they are.  
… but i don't think we can resolve anything on this issue at this meeting.  

### 3. AOB?.
{: #section3}

**Matt Garrish:** anyone who has not responded to the use of the epub properties survey, please do so. We don't want to unnecessarily mark things as under-implemented..  
… please get the word out. This needs to be done to get out of CR.  

**Shinya Takami (高見真也):** can you post a URL for this questionnaire?.  

> *Matt Garrish:* [https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-epub-wg/2022Jun/0013.html](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-epub-wg/2022Jun/0013.html).

**Matt Garrish:** it was actually circulated via email. I can try to pull something up.  
… see link above.  

**Brady Duga:** You can register for TPAC and get early bird pricing now.  
… okay thank you everyone, see you all next time!.  

**Shinya Takami (高見真也):** and thank you duga for volunteering to be special guest chair.
