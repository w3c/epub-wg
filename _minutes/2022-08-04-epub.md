### 1. Status of EPUB 3 Overview.
{: #section1}

_See github issue [epub-specs#2368](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/2368)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/2368 -->



> *Dave Cramer:* See [Overview document](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-overview-33/).

**Dave Cramer:** makoto-san is wondering about the value of the Epub 3 overview document and what we should do about it.  
… this has historically been an entry point into the epub 3 family of specs.  
… it is somewhat out of date, there are things in it which would require some work.  
… the landing page argument is somewhat reduced from the past (we are cut down the number of specs in the family).  
… the individual specs have intro sections.  

**Brady Duga:** mgarrish, ivan, and makoto are most involved, and they are not here.  
… my opinion are that we need to keep it, and that we need to fix the existing issues with it.  
… based on what the thread seems to reflect.  

**Dave Cramer:** there is some value to having something like this.  
… I wish the links took you to the actual other specs rather than the reference section (which then has another outgoing link).  
… but given that the people most involved are not here, I am comfortable postponing this to a future meeting.  

**Shinya Takami (高見真也):** yes, agreed.  
… we cannot discuss with without makoto.  

**Dave Cramer:** keeping it and fixing it seems like a reasonable task.  
… we'll come back to this in another meeting.  

### 2. Re-implement vocabulary association mechanisms as an algorithm (pr epub-specs#2379)
{: #section2}

_See github pull request [epub-specs#2379](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/pull/2379)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/2379 -->



_See github issue [epub-specs#2378](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/2378)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/2378 -->



_See github issue [epub-specs#2382](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/2382)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/2382 -->



**Dave Cramer:** there are a couple issues associated with this (#2378, #2382).  
… this is very technical, I wish mgarrish were here to explain.  
… doesn't really seems to change how the spec works, more an editorial change.  
… seems like they were just looking for WG approval before merging, even though most of us probably won't have strong opinions on this.  
… i'm generally in favor of explaining things in an algorithmic fashion rather than hard to understand paragraphs.  
… maybe we just say that we don't have objection to merging this pending github reviews?.
