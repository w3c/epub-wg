**Charles LaPierre:** RIP Ben, We will deeply miss you.  

**Wendy Reid:** Different format today.  

> *Tzviya Siegman:* CEPC [https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc).

**Wendy Reid:** will be a presentation from Ivan.  
… Then we will focus on tests, including running them.  

### 1. where are we with our work?.
{: #section1}

**Ivan Herman:** [Sharing slides on screen].  
… brief overview of where we are.  

> _Slideset: [https://www.w3.org/2022/Talks/EPUB-IH/?full](https://www.w3.org/2022/Talks/EPUB-IH/?full)_



**Ivan Herman:** odd group, since we are not starting from a blank slate.  
… WG is starting with a long history of work and requirements.  
… 2017 is the starting point of W3C work on epub, but was already on version 3.1.  
… First job was to "fix" 3.1 with 3.2.  
… Now we are on 3.3 on Rec track.  
… Had to go through horizontal reviews, need tests, plus some editorial things.  
… we do require all 3.2 documents to be valid 3.3 documents (in our charter).  
… And epubcheck is coming with 3.3 support.  
… beta release of epubcheck is already available.  

> *Wendy Reid:* [https://github.com/w3c/epubcheck/releases](https://github.com/w3c/epubcheck/releases).

**Ivan Herman:** limited new features (webp and opus media types, and dir attribute in package).  
… epub:type should not be used for a11y anymore, use aria instead.  
… Editorial changes - major reorg.  
… It wasn't obvious where to find things in the old organization.  
… there wasn't clear delineation of author requirements and reading system requirements.  
… Very hard for authors to read through it all and figure out what they should do.  
… New organization breaks out core (for creators), reading systems, and a11y.  
… very thorough review which led to improvements in the spec.  
… some clarification of what we meant (eg URI handling) plus some entirely new sections.  
… Privacy and security sections added.  
… during these reviews we pulled some things out as they weren't really used and were an attack vector.  
… interoperability wasn't very clear, mainly just vague comments.  
… IDPF had some old tests, but they were for a different purpose.  
… created a new test suite for epub.  
… We are *not* duplicating existing suites (eg html, svg, css).  
… No need to test them, since reading systems are typically built on browser engines which are already tested.  
… Focus only on epub specific features.  
… each test focuses on a single normative statement.  
… Currently around 150 tests today.  
… If we can't get two implementations, then we have a problem (more to come).  
… Tests have a pretty table with details of each test.  

> *Wendy Reid:* [https://github.com/w3c/epub-tests](https://github.com/w3c/epub-tests).

**Ivan Herman:** spec and tests are mutually linked (tests point at spec, spec points at test).  

> *Wendy Reid:* [https://w3c.github.io/epub-tests/](https://w3c.github.io/epub-tests/).

**Ivan Herman:** [showing mathml test as example].  
… another example, language, which has no impact on the text of the content, just the metadata.  
… tests uses the quote element.  
… just two examples of what tests look like.  
… we will have a final report.  
… just sample data now, but we need to fill it out with real data.  
… so what happens to statements in the core spec? How do we test those?.  
… epubcheck is the answer.  
… Will take all the epubcheck tests and make a report from those.  
… What about a11y and metadata?.  
… Will depend on usage.  
… need enough organizations using them.  
… What about unimplemented features?.  
… That will be a topic for this f2f.  
… Some features were added because they sounded good at the time and hoped someone would implement it.  
… sometimes that worked, sometimes it didn't.  
… currently called "under-implemented".  
… Risky to use, epubcheck accepts them, but they do not pass the CR tests.  
… Usually in W3C it is more straightforward - just remove the feature.  
… but our charter binds us to backwards compat.  
… So no 3.2 document can be rejected in 3.3.  
… Unusual, but basically our only option.  
… Deprecated features are essentially removed, there are no tests for these.  
… There are also legacy features for epub 2 support.  
… same as deprecated, no tests.  

**Charles LaPierre:** We didn't add any new features, correct?.  

**Ivan Herman:** Only added new features when they were absolutely needed (eg `dir` attribute).  
… and some in security and privacy.  
… examples of under-implemented features.  
… rendition:flow turns off pagination.  
… RS do implement this.  
… but RS do it at user request, not author request.  
… If all RS ignore the author request then we may need to mark as under implements.  
… fallbacks is a trickier case.  
… Given a chain of media types, RS should pick what they can support.  
… May not have many implementations.  
… some features are already removed due to no usage and no implementations.  
… 3.3 is here, technical changes are generally done.  
… start using it for content now.  
… final standard will be published winter next year.  
… please run the tests and return a report.  
… That's all!.  

**Wendy Reid:** Questions? Comments?.  

**Dave Cramer:** That was awesome, thank you!.  

**Wendy Reid:** Intros. Will not be scribing this bit..  

### 2. Testing hackaton.
{: #section2}

> *Wendy Reid:* [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13wgptApSVbQbYzi2L5VXe3D_1QLzJOTGySUAtOxn4sA/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13wgptApSVbQbYzi2L5VXe3D_1QLzJOTGySUAtOxn4sA/edit#gid=0).

**Wendy Reid:** today we'll continue the meeting focusing on testing.  
… there are still few tests that needs to been written.  

> *Wendy Reid:* [https://w3c.github.io/epub-tests/](https://w3c.github.io/epub-tests/).

**Wendy Reid:** then we have to run the tests!.  
… the goal is to finish the creation of the tests and start testing the apps.  

**Ivan Herman:** while writing tests I've run them locally on my mac.  

**Wendy Reid:** the other part is to be sure that the tests are clear.  
… and understandable.  
… tomorrow we want to discuss the results of today.  
… to understand if some tests have to be revisited.  
… check if there are features that are under-implemented.  

> *Wendy Reid:* gpellegrino: Do we need to compile the test results into a JSON file?.

> *Wendy Reid:* dlazin: Yes, that would be the easiest way.

> *Wendy Reid:* gpellegrino: Second question, most reading systems do tweaks on the files before giving them to end users, if we sideload we might get different results?.

> *Wendy Reid:* ivan_: We are testing the correctness of the recommendation, if during the publication process, user agent A does something to the file, compared to the author's version, we have no way of controlling that.

> *Wendy Reid:* [https://w3c.github.io/epub-tests/contributing](https://w3c.github.io/epub-tests/contributing).

**Brady Duga:** we may fail with sideloading.  
… but we may get results if we pass the file trough the publisher pipeline.  

**Ivan Herman:** what happens when a file is sideloaded?.  

**Brady Duga:** the file goes to a completely different pipeline.  

> *Rick Johnson:* this is true for us (VitalSource Bookshelf) as well. Sideloading vs. publisher loading are different processes, and have some feature issues associated with them.

**Ivan Herman:** from my point of view those are two different implementations.  
… in theory I could run all the tests on my mac on Apple Books.  
… so I think ideally that the test results from an engine should come from the engine itself.  

**Matt Garrish:** since there are a lot of tests, do we have a short-list of tests that may be "problematic", so we can start with those?.  

**Brady Duga:** is there a repository for the files?.  

**Wendy Reid:** it's in the github repo.  
… it would be easier to have a sub set of tests, but at the same time I think one goal is to have a feedback on how and where EPUB features work.  
… so having a table with the results I think would be useful.  

**Rick Johnson:** in the early days of epubtest.org we had problems with maintaining it updated.  

**Ivan Herman:** for sure it is complicated to maintain it updated.  
… normally in W3C when a WG ends we create a new maintenance WG for updating the results.  

**Rick Johnson:** the JSON file should contain the version number of the app and the date of the testing.  

**Ivan Herman:** we have a granularity to track implementations on different systems.  

**Tzviya Siegman:** I share Rick's concerns, but we can't continue the specs without the tests. Eventually those will become historical document of the implementations in this year.  

> *Dan Lazin:* [https://w3c.github.io/epub-tests/contributing#implementation-report-files](https://w3c.github.io/epub-tests/contributing#implementation-report-files).

**Wendy Reid:** can we use the JSON metadata so tell if the files where sideloaded or pass through the publishers' pipeline.  

**GeorgeK:** maybe we have the possibility to test if the reading system is accessible, for example testing MathML.  

**Judy Brewer:** I think there are WGs that do accessibility testing on they're specs.  

**Ivan Herman:** I think is up to us to check implementations that are accessible.  
… at this moment our first concern is to test the specs as they are.  

**Wendy Reid:** Maybe we may have a separate feedback for accessibility, also accessibility testing is not always a yes/no test.  
… I think we should focus first on general testing.  

> *Dan Lazin:* To prepare an implementation report (ideally for "your" reading system), copy the xx-template.json file here: [https://github.com/w3c/epub-tests/tree/main/reports](https://github.com/w3c/epub-tests/tree/main/reports).

**Ivan Herman:** we may add to some tests some descriptions for defining what we aspect from screenreader consumption of the content.  

> *Dan Lazin:* Once committed, your RS will appear as a column at [https://w3c.github.io/epub-tests/results#implementations-results](https://w3c.github.io/epub-tests/results#implementations-results).

**Tzviya Siegman:** I think for the vast majority of tests we don't need it since we're based on HTML specs.  
… so we don't have to test it for accessibility.  

> *Wendy Reid:* gpellegrino: My proposal would be to add an additional field to say whether it's been tested with a screen reader.

> *Wendy Reid:* ivan_: Add an additional field in results.

**Matt Garrish:** I agree with tzviya: we should not re-testing the web technologies for accessibility.  
… I would focus on EPUB specific features.  

> *Dan Lazin:* And in general, instructions here: [https://w3c.github.io/epub-tests/contributing](https://w3c.github.io/epub-tests/contributing).

**Wendy Reid:** ok, I think we can start testing.  

> *Dan Lazin:* This is mentioned in that documentation, but the needed (unwritten) tests are [https://tinyurl.com/epub-tests](https://tinyurl.com/epub-tests).

**Wendy Reid:** dlazin_ has put all the info in the IRC.  

**David Hall:** how do we submit the results? Using PRs?.  

**Wendy Reid:** yes, using PRs.  

> *Wendy Reid:* [https://github.com/w3c/epub-tests](https://github.com/w3c/epub-tests).

> *David Hall:* For iOS/Apple Books, you can airdrop an .EPUB and it will ask if you want to open in the Books application..

> *Dan Lazin:* PR for empty implementation reports: [https://github.com/w3c/epub-tests/pull/202](https://github.com/w3c/epub-tests/pull/202).

> *Dan Lazin:* Committed now, so if you fork [https://github.com/w3c/epub-tests/tree/main/reports,](https://github.com/w3c/epub-tests/tree/main/reports,) you can start filling out the major platforms' implementation reports. Have fun!.

> *Dan Lazin:* The current proposal is that, to get us to 2 implementations ASAP, we federate the work of testing Apple, Google, Kobo, and Thorium. (Kobo not committed yet; Wendy is working on it.).

> *Dan Lazin:* So please call out which tests you're going to run (say "I will do all the cnt-* tests for Apple Books on macOS") and we can all merge our work together..

> *Dan Lazin:* And, in the spirit of that ... I will do all the cnt-* tests for Apple Books on macOS :).

> *Dan Lazin:* To map between test *titles* and IDs, see [https://w3c.github.io/epub-tests/](https://w3c.github.io/epub-tests/).

> *David Hall:* Hearing conversation around cnt-svg-css - a missing .epub?.

> *David Hall:* Oh never mind, I'm seeing it now..

> *David Hall:* I can attempt the cnt-* tests for Apple Books on iOS.

> *Dan Lazin:* Thanks, dhall!.

> *Dan Lazin:* Here's the PR for my first batch, as an example: [https://github.com/w3c/epub-tests/pull/204](https://github.com/w3c/epub-tests/pull/204).

> *Dan Lazin:* And yes, alphabetization in Finder is funny, so if you're on a Mac (and maybe other platforms) you may find the .epubs are alphabetized in a funny way relative to the folders..

> *Dan Lazin:* I will now do all the css-* tests for Apple Books on macOS :).

> *Romain Deltour:* I can start with all the pub-cmt-* for Thorium on macOS.

> *David Hall:* Suggestion: Add test name ("cnt-css-fonts") to test documents themselves..

> *Dave Cramer:* it turns out epubcheck doesn't like it when the epub is encrypted :).

> *Dave Cramer:* wrote a test of zip encryption of the container. Having trouble with my GitHub tokens... I'll do a PR when I get that sorted out..
