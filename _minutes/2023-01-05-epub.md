### 1. Discuss Under-implemented Features.
{: #section1}

> *Dave Cramer:* [https://w3c.github.io/epub-tests/results](https://w3c.github.io/epub-tests/results).

**Dave Cramer:** we are getting close to the end. Idea is that we start process of moving to PR soon.  
… given testing is more or less finished, we have a sense of where we are lacking 2 independent implementations.  
… such features are under-implemented.  

**Wendy Reid:** the features in question are package linked record (order and priority), i18n directionality in creator field, css pub text-align last, putting images into nav.  

> *:* Zakim sees mgarrish on the speaker queue.

**Wendy Reid:** also fixed layout orientation duplication as well, but this is more something to be flagged in epubcheck.  
… i don't think we will remove from spec, some have a single implementation.  
… esp. dir on creator field, that will probably get supported over time.  

**Matt Garrish:** can we get rid of the linked record stuff?.  
… we thought there might be json records etc. so we wanted to make rules on prioritization of metadata.  
… happy to say that you can put linked records in if you want, but not officially part of spec.  

**Wendy Reid:** we could take either approach. Either take it out, or say that we don't have evidence that this is an implemented feature.  
… the package linked record ones in particular have no evidence of implementation.  

**Matt Garrish:** some reports of failing the linked records test might actually be N/As. Not sure i've ever seen this feature implemented..  
… there's a case for keeping the directionality stuff, as you said.  

**Dave Cramer:** did we get testing from VitalSource on linked records, etc.?.  

> *:* Zakim sees no one on the speaker queue.

**Wendy Reid:** we did get testing from them, but they reported as N/A for both of those linked record ones.  

**Dave Cramer:** then my instinct is to get rid of them, the use-cases didn't pan out.  

> *:* Zakim sees duga on the speaker queue.

**Wendy Reid:** we have a note re. prefix css properties being out of sync of their proper css equivalents, but i'm in favor of strengthening this to tell people to stop using the prefixes.  

> *:* Zakim sees no one on the speaker queue.

**Brady Duga:** looking at the test reports, it looks like the MO tests still have a bunch of single implementations?.  

**Wendy Reid:** yes, we are hoping for Colibrio to get their tests results in. They seem to be the most accurate.  

**Dave Cramer:** is the problem with these tests that most RS have only supported MO for fxl?.  

**Wendy Reid:** yes.  

**Brady Duga:** are we hoping that the Colibrio results will provide the required implementations?.  

**Wendy Reid:** these tests are SHOULDs with MUSTs within. Supporting MO at all is optional.  

**Brady Duga:** so we don't think this will cause an issue?.  

**Wendy Reid:** no. But I'm still hoping we can get Colibrio's results.  

**Brady Duga:** it would be nice if we just re-did the tests to make them FXL, because then we'd have tons of passes.  

**Dave Cramer:** it seems like it might be less work to just explain this to the Director.  

**Wendy Reid:** for the sake of accuracy it would be nice to have more results for these MO tests.  
… the other one we haven't talked about yet is images in the NAV.  
… not sure if this is actually being done, if we can take out this feature.  

**Dave Cramer:** i'm thinking about the common tactic of using a tiny image if your font doesn't have a special character....  

> *:* Zakim sees shiestyle on the speaker queue.

> *:* Zakim sees no one on the speaker queue.

**Shinya Takami (高見真也):** in JP we use gaiji (small images for representative letters) in Japan but many reading systems cannot treat images in NAV so we will not use images in NAV..  

```html
<li>
    <a href="senanque.xhtml">.
        <img src="imgs/senanque.jpg" alt="Description of the Abbey of Sénanque" 
             title="Image of the Abbey" />
    </a>
</li>
```

**Wendy Reid:** if you don't render the image in TOC, then you're supposed to present the alt-text.  

**Matt Garrish:** if you can't support the image and you don't show the alt-text it's a usability issue.  

**Wendy Reid:** apple books shows nothing at all, and Thorium shows the file path rather than the image or the alt-text.  

**Brady Duga:** this seems like it would be easy to implement. Could some RS just quickly add this feature?.  
… just check if its an image, and if so then grab alt-text and insert it.  

**Wendy Reid:** but how often do you even see non-text in NAV?.  

**Dave Cramer:** so do we have to write something into epubcheck to forbid images in NAV?.  

> *Wendy Reid:* [https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/epub33/rs/#confreq-nav-alt-text](https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/epub33/rs/#confreq-nav-alt-text).

**Wendy Reid:** one solution would be to replace this MUST assertion with a SHOULD. Let RS decide whether to support it.  

> *Shinya Takami (高見真也):* +1.

**Wendy Reid:** we'd have to make these changes to the spec, so that when go to PR it is clear what decision were made.  

**Wendy Reid:** for the package linked record (order and priority) are we in agreement that we will remove because it is not used?.  

**Dave Cramer:** and we have evidence that this feature is not being supported, so we can now kill it.  

> **Proposed resolution: Remove the linked records order and priority requirements from the specification.** *(Wendy Reid)*

> ***Resolution #1: Remove the linked records order and priority requirements from the specification.***
{: #resolution1 .resolution}

**Wendy Reid:** next, i18n dir attribute on package metadata (creator, title). We think this is underimplemented because we just introduced it. We want to keep it, maybe with a note explaining that we think it will be supported.  

**Dave Cramer:** and there are good i18n reasons for it.  
… the ultimately the goal is show that these features are implementable, and there is precedent for that.

> ***Resolution #2: Keep the dir attribute requirements for the package metadata, they are important to i18n, add note explaining it is a new feature.***
{: #resolution2 .resolution}

**Wendy Reid:** next, css epub text-align last. We already have a note discouraging these prefix properties.  

**Dave Cramer:** CSS error handling is really well defined, and we inherit a lot of that. We don't really have to do anything..  
… last, processing of images in NAV document. We said we would move this from MUST to SHOULD.  

> **Proposed resolution: Lower the requirement for processing non-text elements in the nav doc from a MUST to a SHOULD.** *(Wendy Reid)*

{: #resolution3 .resolution}

**Matt Garrish:** should we add any warning to the authoring document about such elements not being supported since we're dropping he requirement?.  

**Wendy Reid:** yeah, a note. Maybe link to the test results or something.  
… fxl orientation duplication test is last, but that's more a test of epubcheck.  

**Matt Garrish:** we're waiting on Romain to do the final release, we're pretty much good to go on that.  

### 2. charter extension, WG continuation.
{: #section2}

**Wendy Reid:** we've also requested a Charter extension. If all goes well, we'll got to PR in 2 weeks (once all final edits are one). But once that's done it would be past the end of Feb, which is when our Charter ends.  
… we are asking for 6 mth extension, which is probably more than we need.  
… but we also have the question of epub3 maintenance WG. Writing the Charter for that will also take some time.  

> *:* Zakim sees no one on the speaker queue.

**Wendy Reid:** the maintenance WG is less work than this one, but the purpose is to keep track of errata, address any issues that may op-up:0020:37:00 `<MattChan>` dauwhe: and that won't require regular meetings or anything? Just keeping an eye on Github and addressing them there.  
… for the Audiobooks maintenance WG, we had maybe 3 calls in total to hash out wording and approve PRs.  

**Dave Cramer:** do we have to make decisions on whether epub 3.3 will be a living standard when we apply for PR?.  

**Wendy Reid:** i think every standard is a living standard unless you opt-out.  
… e.g. for audiobooks the errata we added would have involved going through the whole spec process again.  
… the new process organizes changes in 4 levels of severity. Errata fall within the lower two levels..  
… the level 3 and 4 take you back to the CR stage and you go through the process from there.  

**Matt Garrish:** but for level 3 and 4, reviewers can review the whole spec, not just the things you are changing.  

**Wendy Reid:** one of the other reasons we extended the charter is that there is a non-zero chance we could have a formal objection logged against us, and we'd have to do deal with that as well within our current Charter.  
… since I've already written a maintenance WG charter for audiobooks we can re-use some of that language.  

### 3. ARIA issues.
{: #section3}

> *Matt Garrish:* [https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/epub33/epub-aria-authoring/](https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/epub33/epub-aria-authoring/).

**Wendy Reid:** last is publication for guide for transitioning from epub:type to ARIA roles.  

**Matt Garrish:** this is a guide we made back in the IDPF days for teaching people how to use roles properly.  
… comes up every so often whether we should publish this.  
… we want to republish this as part of the W3C so we're not referring back to IDPF.  
… the information is basically the same, some minor corrections. We could then also reference this from the structural vocab.  

**Wendy Reid:** is this DPUB ARIA 1.1?.  

**Matt Garrish:** it's not specific. It talks about 1.0 but its about how to use roles in general.  

**Wendy Reid:** do we have to give it a short name when we say we're publishing it?.  

> *Matt Garrish:* epub-aria-authoring-11.

> **Proposed resolution: Publish the EPUB ARIA Authoring Guide as a working group note, with the short name "epub-aria-authoring-11".** *(Wendy Reid)*

> ***Resolution #4: Publish the EPUB ARIA Authoring Guide as a working group note, with the short name "epub-aria-authoring-11".***
{: #resolution4 .resolution}

**Matt Garrish:** I'll tell Ivan.  

### 4. AOB?.
{: #section4}

**Dave Cramer:** the meeting next Fri is when we would vote for PR.  

**Wendy Reid:** not next Fri. That one is cancelled. On the 19th we will vote for both PR and ISO.  

**Brady Duga:** is there a quorum for that meeting?.  

**Dave Cramer:** we will vote at the meeting, but leave email open for anyone who can't be there.  

> *lose:* Thu Jan 05 20:51:20 202:00.
