<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/epub">EPUB 3 Working Group</a> invites implementations of the following three Candidate Recommendation Snapshots:</p>

<ul class="show_items">
    <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/CR-epub-33-20220512/">EPUB 3.3</a> defines the authoring requirements for EPUB publications and represents the third major revision of the standard.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/CR-epub-rs-33-20220512/">EPUB Reading Systems 3.3</a> defines the conformance requirements for EPUB 3 reading systems — the user agents that render EPUB publications.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/CR-epub-a11y-11-20220512/">EPUB Accessibility 1.1</a> specifies content conformance requirements for verifying the accessibility of EPUB® Publications. It also specifies accessibility metadata requirements for the discoverability of EPUB publications.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    EPUB® 3 defines a distribution and interchange format for digital publications and documents. The EPUB format provides a means of representing, packaging, and encoding structured and semantically enhanced web content — including HTML, CSS, SVG, and other resources — for distribution in a single-file container. A separate <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-overview-33/">overview note</a> gives a more detailed view of the specifications.
</p>

<p>
    The specification represents the third major revision and, in particular, a revision of the 
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub32/epub-spec.html">EPUB&nbsp;3.2 document</a> 
    published by the EPUB&nbsp;3 Community Group. This new version is now on a W3C Recommendation Track.
    There have been only a few technical additions in the areas of internationalization, security, or
    core media types. The focus of the Working Group have been to align the specifications with the latest
    W3C specifications, current usage and practices of the publishing industry, improve the readability of the
    specification, align the accessibility requirement with the latest Web Accessibility standards as well as the European
    Accessibility Act, and to work on a comprehensive test suite to improve the interoperability of Reading Systems.
