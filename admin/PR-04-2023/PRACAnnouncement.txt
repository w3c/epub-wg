Xueyuan,

here is the draft announcement for the PR transition for the EPUB 3.3. I have already created the PR review form:

https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/33280/epub-pr/

The starting date has been set to the 15 of April to avoid preliminary votes; please,
check it whether it is otherwise o.k. You should set the opening date to the 13rd when the publication is announced.

Thank you!

A separate HPN draft will follow in a separate mail

Ivan
