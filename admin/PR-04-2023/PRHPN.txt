Subject: [DRAFT HPN] Call for Review: EPUB 3.3 is a W3C Proposed Recommendation

----------------------------

<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org//publishing/groups/epub-wg/">EPUB 3 Working Group</a> has published three 
Proposed Recommendations today for EPUB&nbsp;3.3. This technology defines a distribution and interchange format
for digital publications and documents. The EPUB format provides a means of representing, packaging,
and encoding structured and semantically enhanced Web content — including HTML, CSS, SVG, and 
other resources — for distribution in a single-file container.</p>

<p>The three Proposed Recommendations are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/PR-epub-33-20230413/">EPUB 3.3</a> specification defines the authoring requirements
        for EPUB Publications and represents the third major revision of the standard.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/PR-epub-rs-33-20230413/">EPUB 3.3 Reading Systems</a> specification
        defines the conformance requirements for EPUB 3 Reading Systems — the user agents that render EPUB Publications.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/PR-epub-a11y-11-20230413/">EPUB Accessibility 1.1</a> 
        specifies content conformance requirements for verifying the accessibility of EPUB Publications. 
        It also specifies accessibility metadata requirements for the discoverability of EPUB publications.
    </li>
</ul>
