Denis, Jiaying,

As you could see in [1], there is a transition request for a PR, with a publication planned for the 13th of April.
Hopefully we will get the approval of Philippe and Yves in time.

I have already put the document on TR space:

* EPUB 3.3
  https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/PR-epub-33-20230413/
* EPUB 3.3 Reading Systems
  https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/PR-epub-rs-33-20230413/
* EPUB Accessibility 1.1
  https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/PR-epub-a11y-11-20230413/

and we have gone through the pubrules' checker. However, we would appreciate if you 
could check the document whether it is ready for publication, or whether we have to 
make some editorial changes.

Of course, as soon as we get the transition approval, I will send you (i.e., the webmaster) an official
publication request, will send the drafts for the PR AC and HPN announcement drafts to Xueyuan, and I will
prepare the necessary WBS form.

Thanks

Ivan
