Dear webmaster,

This is a preliminary publication request for three Recommendations to come.

Here are the necessary information for the publications.

    Publication date: 2023-05-25
    
    Document Title:  EPUB 3.3 Reading Systems
    Document URL: https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/REC-epub-rs-33-20230525/ (doc already in place)

            https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/505
        Director's approval is expected this week end

All three documents pass the pubrules' check.

The linkchecker reports the following problems:

    - https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf is reported as an error in EPUB 3.3, but it does 
       dereferences properly when clicking on the URL

    - Checking https://www.editeur.org/8/ONIX/ in the EPUB Accessibility document is forbidden via robots.txt, but it does dereferences properly when clicking on the URL

    - A number of HTML/WHATWG fragment ID-s are reported as errors for EPUB 3.3 and EPUB 3.3 Reading Systems, but those are all correct when clicking.
    

Thank You

Ivan
