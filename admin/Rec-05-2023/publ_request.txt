Dear webmaster,

This is an official publication request for three Recommendations.

Here are the necessary information for the publications"

    Document Title: EPUB 3.3
    Document URL: https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/REC-epub-33-20230525/
    Publication date: 2023-05-25
    
    Document Title: EPUB 3.3 Reading Systems
    Document URL: https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/REC-epub-rs-33-20230525/ 
    Publication date: 2023-05-25
    
    Document Title:  EPUB Accessibility 1.1
    Document URL: https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/REC-epub-a11y-11-20230525/ 
    Publication date: 2023-05-25

            https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Team/w3t-comm/2023May/0080.html
            https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/505
        Director's approval:
            https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/505#issuecomment-1554592798

All three documents pass the pubrules' check.

The linkchecker reports the following problems:

    - https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf is reported as an error in EPUB 3.3, but it does dereferences properly when clicking on the URL

    - Checking https://www.editeur.org/8/ONIX/ in the EPUB Accessibility document is forbidden via robots.txt, but it does dereferences properly when clicking on the URL

    - A number of HTML/WHATWG fragment ID-s are reported as errors for EPUB 3.3 and EPUB 3.3 Reading Systems, but those are all correct when clicking.

In cooperation with the chairs of the WG, as well as the staff contact, a draft Press Release has already been prepared:

    https://www.w3.org/2023/05/pressrelease-epub33-rec.html.en

and an HPN news item has already been drafted.

Thank You

Ivan
