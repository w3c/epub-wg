Subject: [DRAFT HPN] Working Group Note: EPUB 3 Structural Semantics Vocabulary

----------------------------

<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org//publishing/groups/epub-wg/">EPUB 3 Working Group</a> 
has just published a Working Group Note
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/NOTE-epub-ssv-11-20211102/">EPUB 3 Structural Semantics Vocabulary 1.1</a> document.
This vocabulary, a part of EPUB 3, defines a set of properties relating to the description of structural semantics of written works.
</p>

<p>
Structural semantics add additional meaning about the specific structural purpose an
HTML (or SVG) element plays. The <code>epub:type<code> attribute, defined in EPUBÂ 3.3, is used to express domain-specific 
semantics in EPUB Content Documents and Media Overlay Documents, with the structural information it carries 
complementing the underlying vocabulary. The applied semantics refine the meaning of their containing elements without
changing their nature for assistive technologies, as happens when using the similar <code>role</code> attribute in HTML.
The attribute does not enhance the accessibility of the content, in other words, only provides hints about the purpose. 
This documents defines the default vocabulary that can be used with the <code>epub:type<code> attribute.
