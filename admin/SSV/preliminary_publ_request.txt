Denis, Jiaying,

As you could see in [1], there is a transition request for a First Public WG Note, with a publication planned for the 2nd of November.
Hopefully we will get the approval of Philippe and Ralph in time.

I have already put the document on TR space:

https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/NOTE-epub-ssv-11-20211102/

and I have gone through the pubrules' checker. However,  we would appreciate if you could
check the document whether it is ready for publication, or whether
we have to make some editorial changes.

Of course, as soon as we get the transition approval, I will send you (i.e., the webmaster) an official
publication request, and I will also send the drafts HPN to Xueyuan.

Thanks

Ivan
